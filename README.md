# AI-Driven-Sanskrit-Manuscript-Fingerprinting-and-Blockchain-Provenance

The proposed research introduces a novel multimodal AI–driven framework that integrates visual manuscript fingerprinting, textual variant analysis, and blockchain-based provenance tracking to preserve and authenticate Sanskrit heritage manuscripts. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on optical character recognition or isolated text digitization, this study fuses image, linguistic, and metadata modalities to generate a unique digital “fingerprint” for each manuscript folio. This fingerprint is then securely anchored on a blockchain ledger, enabling tamper-proof verification of authenticity, version lineage, and custodial history. Furthermore, the framework incorporates an ethical monetization mechanism, ensuring transparent and culturally sensitive value attribution to manuscript custodians, scholars, and institutions. This integrated combination of multimodal AI analysis, blockchain provenance, and ethical economic modeling has not been explored in the context of Sanskrit philology, making the work a first-of-its-kind contribution to the digital humanities and heritage informatics domain.
